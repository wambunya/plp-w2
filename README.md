 README: Python Program for List Operations

This program demonstrates various list operations in Python, including appending elements, inserting at specific positions, extending the list with another list, removing elements, sorting the list, and finding the index of a specific value. Below is a detailed explanation of each step.

Program Overview

The program performs the following operations sequentially:

Create an empty list

An empty list is initialized using my_list = [].

Append elements to the list

Adds elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list using the append() method.

Insert an element at a specific position

Inserts the value 15 at the second position (index 1) in the list using the insert() method.

Extend the list with another list

Extends my_list by adding the elements from another list [50, 60, 70] using the extend() method.

Remove the last element from the list

Removes the last element of the list using the pop() method.

Sort the list in ascending order

Sorts the list in ascending order using the sort() method.

Find the index of a specific value

Locates the index of the value 30 in the sorted list using the index() method and prints it.

Display the final list

Prints the final state of the list for verification.



How to Run the Program

Copy the code into a Python script or an interactive Python environment (e.g., IDLE, Jupyter Notebook).

Execute the code.

Observe the output in the console, which includes:

The index of the value 30.

The final sorted list.
